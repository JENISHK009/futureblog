ðŸ”· Bloggers Ground â€” Detailed UI/UX Prompt with Next.js Structure
The Bloggers Ground website should be a modern, clean, and responsive platform built with Next.js, designed for users to explore and engage with high-quality blogs across various categories. The design must support both dark and light themes, seamlessly toggled by the user, with blue (#007BFF or similar) consistently used as the primary accent color across both modes to maintain brand identity. The secondary palette should include deep black shades (#121212 or #1a1a1a) for dark theme and white/off-white (#f5f5f5) for the light theme backgrounds. Transitions between light and dark modes should be smoothly animated for a refined feel.

1. Homepage
The homepage should have an animated hero section/header that includes a featured blog slider with auto and manual scroll, a slogan/tagline for the brand (like "Fuel Your Curiosity, One Blog at a Time"), and a search bar with subtle input animations. Navigation should be sticky and animated with hover transitions. Below, sections should include trending blogs, categories preview, and a scrolling web stories strip. Use Framer Motion or GSAP for entrance animations and hover effects on blog cards.

2. Blogs Page
This page lists all blogs with filters like Category, Latest, Most Popular, and a search bar. Blogs should load with a fade-in and scale animation as you scroll. On hover, cards should animate with a slight elevation and shadow glow using the primary blue. Clicking a blog takes you to the blog detail page with a smooth transition animation.

3. Blog Detail Page
Each blog opens in a new page with a large animated header image, blog title, author info with animation, and reading time. Integrate a table of contents (TOC) on scroll with sticky positioning. The text should have readability-focused line height and font size, with image zoom-in animations and code block theming for dev-related content. Allow users to like, comment, and share with animation feedback.

4. Web Stories Page
Inspired by Instagram stories or Google Web Stories, this should be a dedicated, animated carousel of short-form content. Each story opens in full-screen modal with auto-swipe and tap navigation. Animated progress bars on top of each story and swipe gestures (mobile-first design) are essential.

5. About Us Page
This page should use parallax scrolling animations and reveal-on-scroll elements to showcase your brand journey, mission, and the team. Include animated avatars of team members, a timeline of milestones, and call-to-actions (CTAs) to contribute or follow.

6. Contact Us Page
Use a form with floating labels, blue-accented focus outlines, and animated error/success messages. Add Google Maps integration with animated pins and a hover effect. The contact form should submit with a loading spinner and a smooth feedback message.

7. Authentication (Login/Signup)
Both login and signup should use a card layout with glassmorphism effect. Animate the toggle between login and signup forms. Input fields should have animated focus states. Optionally support OAuth (Google login) with animated button loaders.

8. Header & Navigation
Create an animated header/navbar that supports sticky behavior, theme toggle (sun/moon icons), animated underline on hover for links, and a hamburger menu for mobile with slide-in side navigation. Use Next.js dynamic routes for links.

General Design & Animation Notes:
Use Framer Motion or GSAP for smooth animations.

For theme toggling, use context + localStorage to persist theme choice.

Transitions should be 300-500ms, with ease-in-out curves.

Typography should be modern, minimal, and accessible, using fonts like Inter, Poppins, or Rubik.
