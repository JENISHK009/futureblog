⚡️ Webstories Page – “Futuristic Snaps of Wisdom” (2050 UI Prompt)
Design the Webstories Page as a visual playground that’s both aesthetic and fast. It must feel like a fluid carousel of ideas with rich animations, edge-to-edge storytelling, and responsive behavior across devices. Think Instagram stories, but make it next-gen and branded in your style.

🎯 Core Features
🖼️ Story Cards Grid (Home View)
Display story previews in a masonry or square grid (3–4 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 full-width slider on mobile).

Each card should:

Have a hover animation: slight tilt + glowing blue border.

Use blue overlays with white text for contrast.

Show story title + category + date in overlay on hover/focus.

Animate in with a zoom/fade combo as you scroll.

🧠 Feature Highlight: Use WebGL or Framer Motion to animate cards based on cursor movement — the whole grid subtly shifts based on mouse angle for depth illusion.

✨ Click-to-View Story (Full Page / Modal View)
When a user clicks a story card, open the story as a full-screen immersive modal or page, with swipe/tap/click navigation between pages of the story.

Features:
Edge-to-edge layout: full height, full width story canvas.

Progress bar at the top (animated blue) that shows user progress through story pages.

Swipable left/right on desktop with arrow keys or buttons.

Tap/swipe on mobile with smooth haptic-style feedback using animation spring effects.

Each Story Page Supports:
Image or Video background with a dark or light overlay.

Floating caption/title block with animated text reveal (slide/fade).

Optional CTA button (“Read Full Blog”, “Explore Topic”, etc.) styled with glowing blue glassmorphic style.

🌓 Theme Design & Color Usage
Element	Light Theme	Dark Theme
Background	#f9fafe / #ffffff	#111418 / #1a1a1a
Card Backgrounds	#ffffff + soft shadows	#1f1f1f + neon edge blue borders
Text Color	#1e1e1e / #333	#f2f2f2 / #cccccc
Primary Accent (Blue)	#007BFF / #2196f3 (gradient optional)	#007BFF / #00bfff (slightly brighter)
Shadow/Hover Glow	Blue neon outer glow	Blue with purple-ish subtle blur
Buttons	Transparent with bold borders or blue	Filled blue or black with neon text
All transitions between dark/light theme should be soft animated with 0.4s duration — especially for story pages.

📱 Responsive Design Behavior
Mobile View:

Grid converts into a horizontal slider of cards (swipeable).

Stories open in fullscreen vertical swiper view.

Action buttons become floating pills at the bottom.

Tablet:

Grid becomes 2-column masonry with fluid drag-to-scroll experience.

Modals still open full screen, but TOC/next/prev buttons float on sides.

Desktop:

Full interactive grid, hover animations enabled.

Story modal with keyboard nav, next/prev arrow controls, and visible CTAs.

🧠 Bonus Features to Consider
Add a "Featured Webstory" carousel at top with animated headline slider.

Use auto-play for stories (like Instagram), with manual pause/play toggle.

Add “Webstory of the Week” with trophy-style animation and spotlight.

Optionally track story view count, show progress of users (gamify!).

🎨 Font Suggestion
Use a sleek, futuristic, but readable font:

Headings: Orbitron, Space Grotesk, or Exo 2

Body: Inter, Satoshi, or Poppins

Use font weight variations and tracking for storytelling tone.
