🔮 2050-Level Home Page Design Prompt for Bloggers Ground
Design the home page of Bloggers Ground to feel ahead of its time, like a digital experience pulled from 2050. The aesthetic should blend futuristic minimalism with bold functionality, immersing the user in a smooth, responsive, animated environment. Use a dark/light hybrid base where blue (#007BFF or neon-cyber blue) is the accent across both modes. Combine this with elegant shades of gray (#2A2A2A to #CCCCCC) and black (#000) for depth and contrast.

✨ Hero Section (Top of Homepage)
Full-screen animated gradient background shifting subtly through shades of deep gray and electric blue.

Centered "Bloggers Ground" logo with a glow animation, like neon signage.

Below the logo, a headline with bold typography:
"Welcome to the Future of Blogging — Curated, Intelligent, Infinite."

Search bar at center:

Shape: Pill or glassmorphic card.

Effect: On focus, expand with a "blue ripple light" animation.

Placeholder text: “Search across the universe of ideas...”

Button: Black circular search button with a hovering pulse glow effect in blue.

Optional: Include AI icon or mic icon with floating animation.

🔁 Featured Blog Slider (Next Section)

Animate on entry (fade and float).

Have dynamic shadows.

Change border color on hover to blue.

Show blog category as a floating label with motion.

🧠 Categories Showcase
Grid layout of categories with icons (animated SVGs or lottie).

When hovering on a category:

Transition between dark and light mode should be smooth with Framer Motion spring animations.

🔄 Web Stories Strip
Horizontally auto-scrolling web story previews like a Star Wars hyperspace effect.

Stories appear in round or vertical pill cards.

Use subtle shimmer animation on hover.

🧠 Smart Recommendation Section
Use AI/ML vibe —
“Because you read tech, you might like this...”

Cards should appear with a staggered animation, like floating in.

🦾 Footer
Futuristic footer with animated glowing lines.

Include “Dark/Light Toggle”, “Contact”, “Privacy”, and animated social icons (hover ripple effect).
