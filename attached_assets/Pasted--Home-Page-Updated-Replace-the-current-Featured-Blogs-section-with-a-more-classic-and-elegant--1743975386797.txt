🏠 Home Page (Updated)
Replace the current "Featured Blogs" section with a more classic and elegant design, using a grid layout with clean blog cards that include the blog title, category, short excerpt, and a “Read More” button.

Ensure each button inside blog cards (like "Read More", "Share", etc.) works correctly and smoothly, with hover effects and animations aligned to the selected theme (dark or light).

Add a Web Stories section below the blog grid:

Use a horizontally scrollable carousel of short stories with vertical preview cards.

Cards should include animated progress indicators, hover effects, and a “View Story” CTA button.

Ensure the overall layout and animations give a futuristic 2050-classic vibe, using the main color scheme (blue, black, white, gray), with responsive design across all screen sizes.

🔐 Login & Signup Pages

Include light/dark theme compatibility.

Ensure responsiveness across devices and clear input validation feedback for every form field.

📝 Blog Page (Browse All Blogs)
Create a clean, modern layout with filters at the top:

Ensure all filters and the search input work correctly, and reset or reload the content when updated.

Each filter or page change should scroll the page to the top automatically.

Title, date, author, category, excerpt, and a “Read More” button.

Smooth hover animations and responsive card layout.

Fully responsive design:

📖 Blog Reading Page
Focus on reader experience:

Use a classic font (e.g., Inter, Georgia, or Space Grotesk) with excellent line height and readability.

Include a floating Table of Contents (ToC) sidebar on desktop; collapsible on mobile.

Add “Back to Top” and “Share” buttons that float or fade in on scroll.

Theme-aware color styling:

Dark Mode: Black background, white/blue text, smooth transitions, and subtle highlights.

Light Mode: White/light gray background, black text, subtle blue highlights, and drop shadows.

Make sure it’s fully optimized for all devices, with touch-friendly buttons, proper spacing, and scroll-syncing for the ToC.
