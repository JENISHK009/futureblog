🔮 Blogs Listing Page – “Explore Universe of Ideas” (2050 Web UI Prompt)
Design the Blogs Page as a dynamic, futuristic directory where users can search, filter, and explore all your blogs with animation-rich interactions and a sleek aesthetic. The layout must be grid-based, ultra-responsive, and minimal yet powerful in feel. Prioritize interactivity, depth, and intelligent user experience.

✨ Core Features
🔍 Animated Search Bar with Intelligence
Centered or top-aligned in sticky position.

Glassmorphic design with transparent background and blurred effect.

On focus: Search input expands with blue ripple glow and a light hum animation.

Placeholder text: “Search topics, ideas, creators...”

Submit button: Black circular with a floating blue aura, animates to a search spinner briefly.

🧰 Filters Sidebar (or sticky horizontal mobile version)
Filters include:

Categories (checkboxes or pills)

Author (dropdown or tag search)

Date (last week/month/year)

Popularity or Most Commented

Each filter should animate on toggle using Framer Motion — slide-in + fade effects.

Selection indicator: Animated blue glow outline with checkmark.

🧱 Blog Cards Grid
2–4 columns responsive grid.

Each card should:

Animate in on scroll with slight elevation and fade.

On hover: Slight tilt, glow shadow, and expand image preview.

Include blog category badge, author chip, read time, and title.

Blog cover image has zoom-in-on-hover with a subtle floating effect.

“Read More” buttons with futuristic pill shape and animated blue wave on hover.

🌗 Theme Adaptability
Cards and layout should gracefully shift between dark and light modes.

Blue accent remains primary in both — used in filters, buttons, highlights, and hover states.

Backgrounds:

Light theme: #f9f9f9 to #ffffff

Dark theme: #0a0a0a to #1e1e1e

All color transitions should be animated for smooth visual comfort.

📱 Responsiveness
Mobile: Filters turn into dropdowns or bottom-sheet style.

Blog cards convert to vertical layout with swipe animations.

Use clamp() CSS for adaptive font sizing.
