📖 Blog Reading Page – “Blog Detail / Single Post”
This is where the magic happens — where users deeply engage with your content. The Blog Reading page should offer a distraction-free, immersive, and elegant reading experience. Combine smooth typography, subtle animations, and intelligent layout to create a premium reading space — like reading in a futuristic e-reader.

🔷 Layout & Content Flow
🎬 Hero Section
Full-width animated featured image at top with soft zoom animation on page load.

Overlay includes blog title, author image + name, date, and read time.

Hero background subtly darkens on scroll for focus on text.

🧭 Sticky Table of Contents (TOC)
Positioned on the left or collapsible floating panel.

Animated scrollspy — highlights the active section.

Sections fade in with staggered animation as user scrolls.

TOC items animate into view with soft slide + opacity transition.

📚 Main Content Area
Typography is king:

Font: Satoshi, Inter, or IBM Plex Serif (modern + highly readable).

Headings: Bold, spaced, futuristic with blue accent underlines.

Body text: High contrast with adequate spacing and line height.

Paragraph Animations:

Fade-in or slide-up on scroll.

Blockquote: Animated vertical blue line with sliding text entrance.

Code blocks: Styled with theme-aware syntax highlighting and subtle neon blue borders.

🖼️ Media & Rich Content
Images: Animated zoom-on-scroll and fade-in.

Videos (if any): Auto-responsive with modern player skin (dark/light matched).

Caption text should float with slight delay for elegant storytelling.

🔁 Share, Like, and Comment
Sticky “Like” and “Share” buttons on the right edge with bounce and tooltip.

Comments section loads only on scroll with staggered animation for each comment.

Comment form:

Dark transparent background with a glowing input outline.

Button: Black with neon blue pulse effect.

📌 Footer / End of Blog
Suggest 2–3 related blogs with floating animation on entry.

“Back to Top” sticky pill button — animated arrow with hover effect.

Theme toggle if not in global header.
